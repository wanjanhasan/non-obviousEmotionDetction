# non-obviousEmotionDetection

This repo is from my work on non-obvious emotion detection from text for the undergrad thesis. The datasets used are 
1. liar,
2. iSarcasm (SEMEVAL_22 task 6) and
3. twitter emotions (crowdflower dataset)

Also included the Exploratory Data Analysis. Bettering it in my own way following the first principles, so I won't be following the already existing algos that may have high scores (Except for the tweet dataset). It will have a lot of mistakes which will be fixed, but rather than overwriting the earlier I'll push the laterst one as a seperate file (So no use looking at the diffs. Rather, check out the latest ones).
